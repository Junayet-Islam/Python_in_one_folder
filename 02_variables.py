# to declare variable....we just need to type the name of the variable we want...then an equal "=" sign....after that we just assign the value of the variable.

# here u should keep something in mind while declaring variable

# 1. u should keep a meaningful name while giving variable's name
# 2. the equal sign means to refer the value we given to the variable.....not the value is equal to the variable...
# 3. u can't use a number to start the varialbe nor any special charecter like @,#,$.........
 
# finally the most important...u should use either camelCase(which is preffered) or snake_case(which is the most suitable for beginners to use multiple worlds)

name = "Junayet Islam" # here we have to use double or single qoutes to declare any string
print(name)

age = 98
