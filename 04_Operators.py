# we have various types of operators......such as arithmetic, logical, bitwise, comparison etc....
# we can have same sign to use as operators in muliple scenarios

# 01. Arithmetic Operators
#----------------------------------------------------------------
# in  arithmetic operators, we use these operators to do maths

# (+)----addition-----x+y 
# (-)----Subtraction----x-y 
# (*-----)----Multiplication----- x*y 
# (/)----Division----- x/y 
# (%)----Modulus----- x%y 
# (**)----Exponests----- x**y 
# (//)----Floor Division----- x//y 


a = 10
b = 20

print (a + b)
print (a - b)
print (a * b)
print (a / b)

c = 10
d = 3
print (c % d)# this is called reminder.......after deviding the numbers...the rest or so called reminder will print

print (c ** d) # this is called the basic power function...like 5**2 is the 5*5 or 5**3 is the 5*5*5

print (c // d) # this gives the division also but don't give the numbers of the decimal....like if the division comes 3.33, it will give 3, the rest will be poped out
